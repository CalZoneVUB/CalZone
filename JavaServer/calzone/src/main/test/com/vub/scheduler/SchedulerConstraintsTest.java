/**
 * Unit test class for the constraints of the scheduler.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of this class is to test wheteher the correct constraints are triggered
 * at the correct situations.
 * This way we can check whether constraints were written correctly.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each test has a certain setup of a {@link Scheduler schedule}.
 * Each test will check if a certain constraint is violated in this setup.
 * Therefore it is necassary that the test environment is created in such a way
 * that one expects that constraint to be violated.
